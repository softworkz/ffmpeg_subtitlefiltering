# FFmpeg Subtitle Filtering


This site provides documentation, tests and examples for the new Subtitle Filtering capabilities in FFmpeg.


The purpose of this repo is documentation and discussion. There's an auto-nuild in place for docs (Markdown). These are automatically published to the Wiki on update, and the Wiki is also the main entry point for reading.
